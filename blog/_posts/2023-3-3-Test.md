I am trying to create a community base of support, so I am freer to explore projects that fulfill my desire for advocacy, are entertaining, and scratch my creative itch. I also would like to build a community platform of mutual support, where I can share what works for me as a person succeeding with executive dysfunction and mental health issues. I'm also an abuse survivor and would like to expand my platform to best serve other survivors and victims.

More community support will give me the freedom, above all else, to say 'no' to projects that don't serve me in my long-term goals, and yes to the ones that are most meaningful to my professed ideals.

- it is 
- so 
- for the 
- ideals.
